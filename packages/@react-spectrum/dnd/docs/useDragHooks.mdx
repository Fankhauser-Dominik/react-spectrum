# Drag and Drop

This page describes how to enable drag and drop functionality for the various React Spectrum components that support it.

## Introduction

Drag and drop is an operation performed when a user "grabs" a UI element via their pointing device and drops it on a different location or element.
It has become a common interaction in many modern applications due to its flexibilty across a variety of use cases but can come saddled with
a variety of accessibility issues, including but not limited to keyboard interaction parity and difficulties mimicking drag operations with mouse emulators.
React Spectrum components that support drag and drop operations seek to address these issues by providing full keyboard and screen reader drag and drop
support.

If you are interested in adding drag and drop support to your own components, feel free to check out the [drag and drop react-aria hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-aria/dnd)!

## API

<FunctionAPI function={docs.exports.useDragHooks} links={docs.links} />

## How to use

Enabling drag and drop for a supported React Spectrum component differs slightly from the typical event handler prop pattern that you maybe familiar with.
Instead of providing each event handler directly to the component, you must first import `useDragHooks` from `@react-spectrum/dnd` package and provide it with
your desired options. `useDragHooks` will then provide you with `DragHooks` that you can pass to the component via the `dragHooks` prop.

You may be wondering why we didn't simply import the drag and drop hooks within the components themselves. The reason behind this is to reduce the bundle size of
the component for users who don't need the drag and drop support for their component.

The following list shows which components currently support drag and drop:
-  [ListView](ListView.html)

### Example

The example below illustrates how one would use `useDragHooks` to enable drag and drop for a ListView. Note how only non-folder type items are made draggable via
the `allowsDraggingItem` option provided to `useDragHooks`. The data transferred during the drop operation is specified by the value returned by `getItems`, in this case
returning plain text matching the text value associated with the dragged row. Finally, the `onDragStart`, `onDragMove`, `onDragEnd` event handlers just need to be provided
to `useDragHooks` and ListView will handle attaching those event handlers to each draggable row.

To perform a drag and drop operations via a keyboard, first select the items to be dragged. You can then start the drag operation by focusing the drag handle on any of the
selected rows and hitting <Keyboard>Enter</Keyboard>/<Keyboard>Space</Keyboard>. Once a drag operation is started, <Keyboard>Tab</Keyboard> can be used to cycle through valid
drop targets. Hitting <Keyboard>Enter</Keyboard> will then confirm the drop operation on the focused drop target. For screen readers, please follow the instructions announced
when focusing the row's drag handle to begin a drag operation.

A custom droppable input element is used in the example below. TODO: ask if we will have a spectrum dropzone or if people will be expected to create their own

```tsx example export=true render=false
import {mergeProps} from '@react-aria/utils';
import {useDrop} from '@react-aria/dnd';
import {useTextField} from '@react-aria/textfield';

function DroppableInput(props) {
  let {label, type} = props;
  let ref = React.useRef();
  let onDrop = async (e) => {
    let text = ref.current.value;
    for (let item of e.items) {
      let type = item.types.values().next().value;
      text = text.concat(await item.getText(type));
    }
    ref.current.value = text;
  };

  let {dropProps} = useDrop({
    ref,
    onDrop,
    getDropOperation(types, allowedOperations) {
      return type && types.has(type) && allowedOperations.includes('move') ? 'move' : 'cancel';
    }
  });

  let {labelProps, inputProps} = useTextField(props, ref);
  return (
    <div style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', width: 200}}>
      <label {...labelProps}>{label}</label>
      <input {...mergeProps(dropProps, inputProps)} ref={ref} />
